# Moon_Lander_Reinforcement_Learning
We teach an agent to play the Lunar Lander game from OpenAI Gym. The agent needs to learn how to land a lunar module safely on the surface of the moon. The state space is 8-dimensional and (mostly) continuous, consisting of the X and Y coordinates, the X and Y velocity, the angle, and the angular velocity of the lander, and two booleans indicating whether the left and right leg of the lander have landed on the moon.
